PROJECT SUMMARY
Imagine if you want to shop for an item and are looking out for the best prices available. In the past, you would have had to go to each of the different dealers (their websites), check for the item on each of those platforms, and then compare the prices yourself. This process is tedious and inefficient to do yourself because there are so many dealers. A price comparison application takes care of this for you.
A price comparison app or website is that platform that is suitable for you depending on your specific shopping intentions, with so many places to shop from, and a wide variety of options and companies offering enticing offers, shopping isn’t as easy as it seems to be. It brings all these deals and presents them to you in one place. Price comparison platforms compare prices across various comparative degrees, simplifying all users, by letting them save time in describing their goods intentions and recommending which one is the best.
It is a platform that will work for both buyers and sellers in the sense that “buyers” compare prices from different sellers and get the best deals. For “Sellers” it enables sellers to see prices that are out there and will work with their product price tags.
Project Team 30 is saddled with a task of developing a website that entails all about prize comparison. At the end of our project we will be able to create a distinguished platform that can satisfy customers so they can use it easily and it will increase business engagement.
